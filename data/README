Notes:

m51:

This FITS file is clipped at 1000 !!! (for casaguides historic reasons)
	  
curl https://casaguides.nrao.edu/images/3/3f/M51ha.fits.txt -f -o M51ha.fits
now fitsedit the header to make it work with the modeling software. Recall
the modeling works in arcmin, not in FITS's degrees. Also the galaxy center
needs to be physical (0,0). Need to cover to rmax=16 (the default in mkgalcube):
    CRVAL1 = 0
    CRVAL2 = 0
    CDELT1 = 0.032
    CDELT2 = 0.032
No need to change CRPIX, although it's somewhat suspiciously at (512,512) for
this 1024 x 1024 image.
