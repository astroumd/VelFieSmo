Smoothing of Galactic Velocity Fields, a Summer 2019 Gradmap Study


## Installation

Your python should have astropy, specutils, pyspeckit. Usually via pip. There are also conda channels.

## Examples

The various versions of cubespectrum*.py are a mess, as they are experiments using different fits access methods and more.
One of the goals is to make a nice clean version of this script.

    ./cubespectrum12.py ../data/ngc6503.fits
    ./cubespectrum12.py ../data/ngc6503.fits  244 182
    ./cubespectrum12.py ../data/ngc6503.fits  161 128
    ./cubespectrum12.py ../data/ngc6503.fits  77 85
